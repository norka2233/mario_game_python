## About The Project

I believe almost everyone knows what the game Mario is and used to or still plays it.
The idea of creating this game came from <b>Cyberbionic Systematics</b> who actually created learning videos of the creation.




### Built With

- Python 3+
- Python module pygame


## Getting Started

Basically to get started all you need is to clone the repo <a href="https://github.com/norka2233/mario_game_python" target="_blank">Mario</a>.
All needed infrastructure is ready. For the correct launch of the program <b> Python 3+ </b> version is required.
